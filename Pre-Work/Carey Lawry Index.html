			<h1>Carey Lawry's 'Hello World' Page</h1>
				<h2>What Kind of Classmate am I?</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>I'm always terrified to ask questions, but force myself to because...you only know what you know, ammiright?</li>
							<li>I tend to go to the TA a LOT for questions...sorry in advance, Jia!</li>
							<li>I like to collaborate and discuss with other classmates. Wether it's me getting help from you, or me helping you, we all help each other in the end.</li>
							<li>I enjoy collaborating in an environment that won't "shhhsh" our table. Snack options are a big plus.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				<h2>What do I enjoy when I am not mastering app development?</h2>
					<p>Running has been a big part of my extracurriculur life for the past few years. I can't (term used loosely) work out unless I am training for something (most often a half-marathon) so any suggestions on great Oregon races are welcome!</p>

					<p>If I'm not out running, I'm probably gardening, stalking any and all pug-related events in the PDX area, and trying to adjust to the public transit system in Portland...it's quite a change from New York!</p>
				<h2>And Now, a Few Images for Context</h2>
